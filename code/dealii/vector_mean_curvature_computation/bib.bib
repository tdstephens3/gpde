% REMINDER: How to use latex bibliography tools:
%				(excellent resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX)
%
% FIRST: use the following lines in the myFile.tex file:
%
% 		  %Bibliography
% 		  \bibliographystyle{plain}     
% 		  \bibliography{/Users/tds/Archives/References/bib}
%
% SECOND: from the command line:
%         i. bibtex myFile (without the file extension .tex)
%			ii. pdflatex myFile.tex (run this twice)
%
