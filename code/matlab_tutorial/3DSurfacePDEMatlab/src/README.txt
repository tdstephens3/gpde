This folder contains the general functions that may be necessary for the various solutions methods of solving the laplace beltrami
equation on a surface.  The functions that are specific to a surface or solution or implementation will be housed in their respective
folders along with the main execution scripts.  The folder src/ should be added to your MATLAB search path which can be done temporarily

addpath('/path/to/src/');

or more permanently using the set path function in the General MATLAB tab.
